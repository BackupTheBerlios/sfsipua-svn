                                   JRTPLIB (v3.4.0)


                      Developed at the The Expertise Centre for 
                      Digital Media (EDM), a research institute  
                              of the Hasselt University

LIBRARY LOCATION AND CONTACT
============================
Normally, you should be able to download the latest version of the library
from this url:
	http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/jrtplib/jrtplib.html

If you have questions about the library, you can mail me at:
	jori@lumumba.uhasselt.be
	
There is also a mailing list for the library. To subscribe to the list, 
send an e-mail with the text 'subscribe jrtplib' as the message body (not 
the subject) to majordomo@edm.uhasselt.be and you'll receive further 
instructions.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
==============
I would like thank the people at the Expertise Centre for Digital Media
for giving me the opportunity to create this rewrite of the library.

INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

* To compile the library on a unix-like platform, just start the configure
  script. This should generate a makefile which you can use to start
  building the library using 'make'.

* To compile the library on an MS-Windows platfrom: Visual Studio
  workspace files are included. The project will search
  for JThread files in ..\jthread-1.1.2
  To compile the library without using JThread, comment the line
  with RTP_SUPPORT_THREAD in rtpconfig_win.h
  Note that for Visual Studio 6, you must have service pack 6 for 
  installed to be able to compile the library.

* For a manual about the library, please refer to doc/ subdirectory.
  Using 'make doc', a PDF version of the documentation will be built.
  Note that you'll need to have the pdflatex LaTeX compiler installed.
  Alternatively, you can download the documentation from the homepage:
  http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/jrtplib/jrtplib.pdf

* For systems with low memory or for applications which will involve only
  a few participants at a time:
  You can set the HASHSIZE defines in rtpsources.h, rtpudpv4transmitter.h
  and rtpudpv6transmitter.h to a lower value to avoid memory being wasted.
  Note that the library will have to be recompiled.

* Used defines:
	- WIN32:
		For compilation on an Win32 platform.
	- _WIN32_WCE:
		Define needed for compilation on a WinCE platform
	- RTP_HAVE_SYS_FILIO:
		Set if <sys/filio.h> exists.
	- RTP_HAVE_SYS_SOCKIO:
		Set if <sys/sockio.h> exists.
	- RTP_BIG_ENDIAN:
		If set, assume big-endian byte ordering.
	- RTP_SOCKLENTYPE_UINT:
		Indicates that getsockname used an unsigned int as its
		third parameter.
	- RTP_HAVE_SOCKADDR_LEN:
		Indicates that struct sockaddr has an sa_len field.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_IPV4MULTICAST:
		Enables support for IPv4 multicasting.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_THREAD:
		Enables support for JThread.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_SDESPRIV:
		Enables support for RTCP SDES private items.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_INLINETEMPLATEPARAM:
		If set, the compiler should be able to handle an inline
		function as a template parameter.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_PROBATION:
		If set, a few consecutive RTP packets are needed to validate
		a member.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_GNUDRAND:
		If set, the RTPRandom class will use drand48_r and srand48_r
	- RTP_SUPPORT_RANDR:
		If set and RTP_SUPPORT_GNUDRAND is not set, the RTPRandom
		class will use rand_r.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_GETLOGINR:
		If set, the library will use getlogin_r instead of getlogin.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_IPV6:
		If set, IPv6 support is enabled.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_IPV6MULTICAST:
		If set, IPv6 multicasting support is enabled.
	- RTPDEBUG:
		Enables some memory tracking functions and some debug routines.
