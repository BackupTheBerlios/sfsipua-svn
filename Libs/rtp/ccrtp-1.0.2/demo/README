	This directory includes example programs intended for testing
and illustrating features of ccRTP:

	* rpthello: illustrates transmission/reception of RTP packets
	using the RTPSession class.

	* rtpsend: sends RTP/RTCP packets

	* rtplisten: waits for RTP/RTCP incoming packets

	* rtpduphello: illustrates transmission/reception of RTP packets
	using RTPDuplex

	* ccrtptest: this is not really a demo program, it performs a
	number of tests over some core functionality as well as some
	tricky aspects in order to check that ccRTP works well.
