// A very simple mu-law encoded audio player.

// This is an introductory example file that illustrates basic usage
// of ccRTP. You will also see a bit on how to use CommonC++ threads and
// TimerPort.

// I am a player of \mu-law encoded RTP audio packets. I 
// do not accept any arguments.

// Some consts common to audiorx and audiotx
#include <audio.h>
// In order to use ccRTP, the RTP stack of CommonC++, you only need to
// include ...
