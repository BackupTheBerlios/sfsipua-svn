- simplified incoming queue for only 1 source / or a low number of
sources.

- preallocated buffers mode for scheduling queue.

- QueueRTCPManager::expireSSRCs

- remove conflicting addresses after 10 RTCP report intervals 

- add separated collision and loop counters?

- check robust handling of payload change

- BYE packets are always sent with a preceding _empty_ RR. Add more info.


API additions:

- Add user interface for RTP header extensions  

- Interface for CSRC list and RTCP reports about CSRCs, for RTP mixers

- provide/improve NTP-RTP mapping interface

- encryption: no, full, RTP and non-SDES RTCP packets: provide
'setEncryptionMode' method and virtuals for encryption
implementation. setKey method.

More TODO:

- Test ccRTP following RFC 3158: ``RTP Testing Strategies'', 

- adaptive jitter buffer schemes

- Address the enhanced/best-effort service issue

- QueueRTCPManager::QueueRTCPManager(..): path MTU is always assumed to be 1500

Experimental things, close everything up here before looking down here:

- Implement SSRC sampling algorithm

- Consider SRTP, (SAVP profile)

- Consider RTCP Feedback profile (AVPF profile)
