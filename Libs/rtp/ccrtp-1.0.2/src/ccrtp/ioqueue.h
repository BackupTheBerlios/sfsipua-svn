	 * Get the timestamp that should be given for a packet whose
	 * payload sampling instant corresponds to the current system
	 * time.
	 *
	 * The timestamp applications should provide for each packet
	 * represents the sampling instant of its payload and should
	 * not be a reading of the system clock. Nevertheless, the
	 * internal operation of the RTP stack relies on the accuracy
	 * of the provided timestamp, since several computations
	 * assume that there is a certain degree of correspondence
	 * between the timestamp and the system clock.
	 * 
	 * It is recommended that applications use this method in
	 * order to <em>periodically adjust the RTP timestamp</em>.
	 *
	 * In particular, it is advisable getting the timestamp
	 * corresponding to the first sampling instant or any instant
	 * after a period of inactivity through a call to this method.
	 *
	 * Applications should use the nominal sampling or
	 * any other value provided by the coder in order to compute
	 * the next timestamps with minimum computational requirement.
	 *
	 * For instance, an application using an RTP profile that
	 * specifies a fixed sampling rate of 8 Khz with eight bits
	 * per sample, continuously transmitting audio blocks 80
	 * octets long, would transmit 100 packets every
	 * second. Every packet would carry a timestamp 80 units
	 * greater than the previous one. So, the first timestamp
	 * would be obtained from this method, whereas the following
	 * ones would be computed adding 80 every time. Also the
	 * timestamp should be increased for every block whether
	 * it is put in the queue or dropped. 
	 *
	 * The aforementioned increment can be obtained from the
	 * RTPDataQueue::getTimestampIncrement() method rather than
	 * computing it by hand in the application.
	 *
	 * @note Frame based applications must follow a specific
	 * timestamping method, probably specified in a profile.
	 *
	 * @note You should take into account that by default ccRTP
	 * assumes that the application begins sampling at the queue
	 * creation time.  Moreover, the first sampling instant is
	 * assigned a "user visible" timestamp of 0, although the RTP
	 * stack will then add internally a ramdom offset unknown to
	 * the application.  That is to say, the application may count
	 * samples from 0 in order to get the timestamp for the next
	 * packet, provided that the first sampling instant is the
	 * same as the queue creation time.  Nevertheless, this
	 * simpler way of starting will not be as accurate as it would
	 * be if the application got at least the first timestamp
	 * through getCurrentTimestamp.  <em>We provide this option
	 * since ccRTP interface is evolving, but we admit that it is
	 * ugly, we could remove this option or even replace uint32
	 * timestamps with a restrictively regulated object;
	 * suggestions are gladly welcomed</em>
