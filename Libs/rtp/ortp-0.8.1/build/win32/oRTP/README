What is it ?
************

MS VisualC++ Workspace and Projects to build oRTP (and test tools) on Win32 systems.

What are the build prequisites ?
********************************

Install some Win32 libraries on your system:
- Download all glib, libiconv, libintl, pkgconfig related files from http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html
- Unzip all files under a same root. You should now have both source files and libraries (dlls).
- Add directory paths for include files and library files to MSVC. 


How to build ?
**************

- Open the oRTP Workspace in the oRTP directory (~\linphone\oRTP\build\win32\oRTP\oRTP).
- Projects (oRTP + one for each test tool) are all added to this workspace.
