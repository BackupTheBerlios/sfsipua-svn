	- make package modifications
	- make rpm added

Tuesday July 4 2005: ortp-0.7.1pre3
	- improve automatic jitter buffer: no more closed-loop; just estimation.
	- merge patch for multicast from Samuel Thibault
	- merge patch for parsing of rtcp packets from Nicola Baldo
	- add static payload definitions for g723.1 and g729.

Wednesday November 17 2004: ortp-0.7.0 series starts
	- add automatic jitter buffer:
		* compensate clock slides
		* estimate the jitter and sets the minimum jitter compensation delay accordingly	
	- posix timer simplified
	- less system calls: use non blocking recv() and don't use select() or poll()
	- add new functions for optimized packet sending
	- recv() and send() are always made within the rtp_session_recv..() and rtp_session_send..()
		functions. That means that scheduled non blocking mode does no more work as it worked before, ie 
		that packet will be sent immediately rather than being sent on time by the scheduler as it was before.
	- HPUX kernel target removed.
	- scheduler always built.
