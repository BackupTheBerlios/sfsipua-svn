				JRTPLIB ChangeLog
				
				   -----------

 2.9 (July 2004)
 	* Fixed bug in rtpsrclist.cpp. Thanks to Lukasz Bobowiec 
	  (bobowiec@icslab.agh.edu.pl)
	* Added function in RTPSourceData which returns the IP address
	* Changed the random routines. Thanks to Jaap Keuter
	  (jaap.keuter@xs4all.nl)
	* Made the shared library link against libstdc++ if possible.
	  Thanks to Anatoly Yakovenko (aeyakovenko@yahoo.com) for the
	  suggestion.

 2.8 (January 2004)
 	* Added code to avoid a crash when receiving a malformed packet
	* Fixed a memory leak (forgot to free memory when a malformed
	  packet was discarded)
	* Changed debug routines for memory tracking

 2.7b (November 2003)
 	* Only added --enable-fpic and --enable-fPIC to the configure script

 2.7 (December 2002)
 	* Fixed important bug in rtpsources.cpp. This bug could cause
	  source information to get lost and could create a memory leak.
	* Improved support for AIX in multicasting code (uses _AIX define). 
	  Thanks to Klaus Matuschek (klaus.matuschek@infonova.com)
	* Fixed possible buffer overrun in rtpcontributingsources.cpp

 2.6 (January 2002)
	* This release only contains some minor changes
	* An 'install' target was added to the Makefile
	* Some newlines were added add the end of certain files to avoid
	  compiler warnings
	* Improved the jitter calculations somewhat 

 2.5 (December 2000)
 	* Added the possibility for the user to receive the raw RTCP packets.
	* Fixed a bug in RTPContributingSources::CreateLocalCNAME(). In this
	  routine, the wrong length was passed to 'gethostname'. Thanks to
	  Sergey V.Shpital (sergey@page.net.ru) for bringing this to my
	  attention.
	* Added a routine to set the Type of Service (ToS) field of the
	  outgoing packets (both RTP and RTCP). Thank to Philippe Cardon
	  (philippe.cardon@bt.com) for writing this code.
	* Fixed a bug in the 'packets lost' calculation. Thank to Domingo 
	  Cuevas Jr. (dcj@onebox.com) for helping me find this bug.
	* Fixed a bug in the sequence number and jitter calculation: when
	  packets were received out of order, the sequence numbers and
	  jitter got messed up. Many thanks to Mohammad Tawsheeq Russool 
	  (m.russool@eim.surrey.ac.uk) for helping me track down these
	  bugs.
	* Added the possibility to set the timestamp unit for a particular
	  source. Previously, it was assumed that their timestamp unit
	  was the same as that of the local session.

 2.4 (July 2000)
 	* Fixed a bug which caused all CSRC's except one to be incorrect.
 	* Added RTP header extension support (for both sending and receiving).
 	* Added some things (which should have been there already) to
 	  RTPPacket.
 	* Adjusted the way in which the login name is retrieved on unix-like
 	  systems. First I used a call to 'getlogin', but apparently this
 	  function messes with timers through the use of 'alarm' calls (at
 	  least on Linux). Now, I use a combination of 'geteuid' and
 	  'getpwuid' to obtain the necessary information. This does not
 	  have that problem and is a lot cleaner since it doesn't depend
 	  on login info (utmp) like 'getlogin'. Thanks to Roberto Jung Drebes
 	  (drebes@inf.ufrgs.br) for pointing out the timer-problem.
 	* Made a LaTeX version of the manual and tutorial. Looks a lot nicer.
 	* Made it possible for the user to specify the local IP address
 	  instead of letting the library figure it out itself.
 	* Fixed a bug which caused the 'fraction lost' in a RR packet to be
 	  zero all the time. Thanks to Domingo Cuevas Jr. (dcj@onebox.com) for
 	  pointing this out.
 	* Rewrote the RTCP packet sending routines. Now, they are much cleaner
 	  and much more understandable :)
 	* Added better support for RTCP 'APP' packets. You can now both send
 	  and receive APP packets.

 2.3 (April 2000)
 	* The routine which creates and sends RTCP packets is now a bit faster.
 	* Added a sample that demonstrates the round-trip time function.
 	* Added functions to RTPSourceData: now the time when the last RR or
 	  SR report was received can be retrieved. Also, the round trip time
 	  can be retrieved: this is calculated as suggested in RFC 1889.
 	* Fixed a bug: the LSR value was not calculated correctly, now it is
 	  (or should be ;-) )
 	* Instead of specifying defines on the command line, they are now
 	  defined in a config file. The unix version of this file is created
 	  by the configure script.
 	* Added a member to RTPPacket which I had forgotten (the payload type,
 	  which is obviously important :-) ).
 	* The library should now be able to work on a VxWorks platform. Thanks
 	  to Dave Osborne (dosborne@argoneng.com) for his help.
	* Added a tutorial and a small example application.
 	* Added some debugging routines (RTPDebug class) to check for memory
 	  leaks. It turned out that there weren't any, so I'm pretty pleased ;)
 	* I've added a 'configure' script to make compilation a bit easier
 	  across different platforms. Thanks to Qi Han (qh1c4@mizzou.edu) for
 	  helping me to improve the support for the Solaris platform. Also
 	  many thanks to Dario Maggiorini (dario@netdev.usr.dsi.unimi.it) for
 	  helping me test the script on several platforms.
 	* Added multicasting support.
	* A bug in rtpsourcedata.cpp was pointed out and fixed by Ramon Clout
	  (ramonc@win.tue.nl). Many thanks for this, Ramon.

 2.2 (February 2000)
 	* Extra support for Sun and HP. Thanks to Henry Lau (hlau@nuera.com)
 	  and Justin Matthews (jmatthews@nuera.com) for this information.
 	* The 'Poll' routine in rtpconnection.cpp has been altered. Now, the
 	  routine should work even if there's that ioctl bug (previously, this
 	  bug was only taken into consideration on a Windows platform).
 	  Thanks to Justin Matthews (jmatthews@nuera.com) for his bugreport.
 	* Added some routines to RTPSession to get the local IP address and the
 	  port number of the sending socket.
 	* 'install' rule added to the makefile.
 	* Added the define 'RTP_SOCKLENTYPE_UINT'. See README.TXT for more
 	  information about this.

 2.1 (December 1999)
	* First release of jrtplib.
	* Added member functions of RTPSession to retrieve the used sockets.
	* Made the destination list faster by using a hash table.

 2.0 (August 1999)
 	* First decent implementation of RTP. Entirely rewritten since 1.0.

 1.0 (August 1999)
 	* First implementation of RTP. There were a lot of things that weren't
 	  quite right and the organisation of the classes was quite nasty.
 	  However, I learned a lot about RTP making this version, and so it
 	  allowed me to make a good start on version 2.0.
