                             Notes about JRTPLIB (v2.9)



LIBRARY LOCATION AND CONTACT
============================
Normally, you should be able to download the latest version of the library
from this url:
	http://lumumba.luc.ac.be/jori/jrtplib/jrtplib.html

If you have questions about the library, you can mail me at:
	jori@lumumba.luc.ac.be

INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

* To compile the library on a unix-like platform, just start the configure
  script. This should generate a makefile which you can use to start
  building the library using 'make'.

* If you intend to use the library on a VxWorks system, you should run the
  configure script with option '--target=vxworks'.

* For a manual about the library, please refer to doc/manual.txt.
  A tutorial can also be found in the 'doc' directory.

* If you should want to make some manual adjustments, it's probably
  useful to know that these are the defines in use:
	WIN32
		If defined, the library will compile for use on a MS-Windows
		system, using Winsock socket functions. Otherwise, a unix-like
		environment is assumed and those socket functions will be
		used. This define used to be WINVERSION, but I changed it
		because Visual C++ automatically defines 'WIN32' in its
		projects.
	RTP_BIG_ENDIAN
		If defined, the library will compile for use on a big endian
		system, if not it will compile for a little endian system.
	RTP_SOCKLENTYPE_UINT
		If defined, the last parameter in functions 'getsockname' and
		'recvfrom' will be of type 'unsigned int *', otherwise it's an
		'int *'.
	RTP_HAVE_SYS_FILIO
		On some systems (on Solaris anyway) an extra file needs
		to be included ( sys/filio.h ). This define make sure this
		file gets included.
	RTP_MULTICAST
		This define specifies if the library should de built with
		support for multicasting.
	RTP_VXWORKS
		This define is used to compile the library on a VxWorks 
		system.
	RTPDEBUG
		If you enable this, the library will use some memory tracking
		routines to check for memory leaks. Note that this will 
		slightly alter some class definitions, so you must also enable
		this flag when you're compiling a program with this debug
		version of the library. You probably don't need this define,
		unless you're making some serious changes to the library. To
		enable it, you should just uncomment the appropriate line in
		'rtpconfig.h'
