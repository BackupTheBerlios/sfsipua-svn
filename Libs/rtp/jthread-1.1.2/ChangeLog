                                JThread ChangeLog
				  
			 	    ---------


 1.1.2 (September 2005)
 	* Win32 version now uses _beginthreadex instead of CreateThread.
	  This should be a safer function. Thanks to Zhu Jin Hong
	  (labile@21cn.com) for pointing this out.
	* Added WinCE support.
	* Switched to automake.

 1.1.1 (December 2004)
 	* Added necessary 'CloseHandle' calls for the thread handle in 
	  the Win32 version of 'jthread.cpp'. Thanks to Nils O. Selasdal
	  (NOS@Utel.no) for pointing out the handle leak.

 1.1.0 (September 2004)
 	* Important change: In your own void *Thread() function, you
	  now have to call JThread::ThreadStarted() at the start of
	  the function. Until this function is called, the Start()
	  function blocks. This way, when the Start() function is
	  finished, we can be really really sure that our own thread
	  is running.

 1.0.1 (August 2004)
 	* configure now detects pdflatex and listings package: 
	  only if these are found, documentation is built.

 1.0.0 (February 2001)
 	* Initial release
	* Thanks to Stijn Vansummeren (stijnvs@lumumba.luc.ac.be) for fixing
	  a bug in the JThread::GetReturnValue() function
