"The GNU oSIP library" is part of the "GNU project".  You  can  check
www.fsf.org for more information about being part of the "GNU project".

This is "the GNU oSIP library". It has been designed
to provide the Internet Community a  simple  way  to
support the  Session  Initiation  Protocol.  SIP  is
described in  the  RFC3261  which  is  available  at
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt.


FEATURES: (version 0.9.6)
---------

The oSIP library consists of 2 parts:

PARSER:
  *  SIP URL parser.
  *  SIP message parser. (and accessor API)
  *  SDP message parser. (and accessor API)
  *  MIME support for message with multiple attachments. (not tested)

TRANSACTION LAYER:
  *  2 states machines for "client transaction" (INVITE and other).
  *  2 states machines for "server transaction"
  *  user controls the application with events.
  *  events managed by the oSIP stack are announced through callbacks.
  *  A SDP framework for quick negotiation. (for UAC/UAS only)
  *  dialog handling facility. (for UAC/UAS only)
  *  timers management framework.

EXTRA:
  *  Porting the library is done through the "port_" files.
     keep in mind that you can replace the libraries where
     you find the threads, mutex and semaphore facilities.
     Please redistribute your ports to jack@atosc.org.
  *  oSIP is not tight to any design! You can use the library
     either in a multi-threaded environment or not, use your
     own interruption's mechanism for timer, or use your own
     transport protocol...

Documentation:
--------------

Yet available:
  *  this README file.
  *  Documentation link at http://www.gnu.org/software/osip/

Installation procedure:
-----------------------

The library is known to compile on various platform:
  *  GNU/Linux
  *  OpenBsd 3.1/3.2  // (FreeBSD&NetBSD should also work)
  *  Windows NT/95/2000 (VC++6.0 or cygwin)
  *  Solaris

Extra set of OS where some version of oSIP has been ported.
  *  HP-Unix.
  *  VxWorks.
  *  Some embedded systems with linux.

The INSTALL file describes the compilation process.

Tests programs:
---------------

NOTE: "josua" is available on osip.atosc.org/download and is used
      to test the oSIP stack. Also, you can download a Proxy server
      "partysip" at www.partysip.org.

For basic test, type the following command line:

  $> make check

For more testing: (!!!DON'T WORRY, SOME TESTS MUST FAIL!!!)

  *  ./test/torture_test: test the SIP parser.
  *  ./test/torture_sdp: test the SDP parser, its accessor API and the
                         framework for negotiation.

  *  ./test/turl      : test the sip-urls parser.
  *  ./test/tto       : test some 'to' fields
  *  ./test/tfrom     : test some 'from' fields
  *  ./test/tcontact  : test some 'contact' fields
  *  ./test/tvia      : test some 'via' fields
  *  ./test/tcallid   : test some 'call-id' fields
  *  ./test/tcontentt : test some 'content-type' fields

How to use the test programs:

  Some SIP and SDP samples are provided in conf/torture_msgs
                                           conf/torture_msgs2
                                           conf/torture_sdps

	./test/torture_test conf/torture_msgs 0
	./test/torture_test conf/torture_msgs 1 -v
	./test/torture_test conf/torture_msgs 3 -v -c

	./test/torture_sdp conf/torture_sdps 3
	./test/torture_sdp conf/torture_sdps 3 -v
