TODO file for oSIP.

Soon to come?
  *  Make the Documentation more up to date...
        * current is about 0.7.X.
  *  improve management of transport layer. (only UDP is completed)
	4 types should be defined:
	TCP, UDP, UNKNOWN_RELIABLE, UNKNOWN_UNRELIABLE.
  *  Support for multiple header on the same line (partially done)
	* Some nasty behavior can still exist for unknown header
	that accept ',' in their definition.
  *  Support for FreeBSD (semget, semop...)
  *  See BUGs file

Distant future?
  *  Add a UAC_UAS_Core_Layer?
  *  Add a Proxy_Core_Layer?
