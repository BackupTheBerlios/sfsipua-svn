This is a sample Trillian capture component.  This will work with Trillian Pro v2.0 and higher.  Note that only Trillian Pro uses plugins.

To compile the sample dll, use Visual Studio with the project file.  It will also ask you
to save a solution.  You can build a release and debug version.  Place the dll in Trillian's plugin directory (i.e. C:\Program Files\Trillian\plugins).  Then enable the plugin by going into Trillian's preferences, clicking on Plugins, and selecting the checkbox beside "Google Desktop Search Plugin".
