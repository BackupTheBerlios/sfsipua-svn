This is the GVI indexing plug-in for Google Desktop. GVI is the file format
used by Google Video for downloaded videos.

This plug-in uses the Google Desktop Index API to extract indexable content from
these files.

To build the plug-in, open 'GoogleDesktopComponentGVI.sln' with Microsoft Visual
C++ Studio. You may compile either a release or a debug build. Run
debug_install.bat to install a debug build, or release_install.bat to install a
release build. Use the corresponding *_uninstall.bat files to uninstall the
plug-in.
